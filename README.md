# CGFS Composable Context Tutorials

## CGFS(Context Graph File System)

## Description

The way I like to code is by first getting a vairty of modifyable working examples up and running then modifying then playing with them getting a variety of functionality up and running. If I maintain a variety of simple examples I can start to put them together like lego blocks until I arrive at the final CGFS POC.
